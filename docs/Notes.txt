"one fair warning is the same course can change their crn every semester so u prob dont want to aggregate ur data on CRN (one mistake i made :/)"

Chron job to schedule pull updates via Github / API.

Merge main into current branch
git remote update
git merge remotes/origin/main
git status

git add _changed_file_

test that it builds
(git add _changed_file_ again if need after fixing)
git merge --continue

git log will show that the remotes/origin/main has merged into current branch

When creating a new branch each week:
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b _new_branch_name_
